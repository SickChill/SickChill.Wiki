## Frequently Asked Questions & Answers (FAQ)

**Does Sickbeard TVRage support NAS hardware?**

Yes. There are pre-built NAS versions of Sickbeard:
* [For QNAP](http://bit.ly/1j5WtdN) 
* [For Asustor](http://bit.ly/1pFr1rW)

**Error: Rar Not Supported: No suitable RAR unpacker installed**

Sickbeard has ability to unpack RAR-archived releases but is distributed without OS-specific UNRAR binary. If you get this error, your need to download RAR binary and place it in _SickBeard-TVRage/lib/unrar2/_
* RAR Binary for Windows: [UNRAR for Windows] (http://www.rarlab.com/rar/unrarw32.exe)
* RAR Binary for OS X: [UNRAR for OS X] (http://www.rarlab.com/rar/rarosx-5.1.b3.tar.gz) - then _chmod +x unrar_ in Terminal.
