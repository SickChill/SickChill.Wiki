To increase security and take steps that attempt to protect users from common mistakes, we are moving to require that users set a username and password when they are allowing direct access to their server from the internet.

You will see a notice such as "In order to access SickChill from a public location, you must set a username and password." with a link to this page if you do not have a username and password set for your install.
