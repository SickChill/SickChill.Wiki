## What are network logos.?

Network logos show a picture instead of a plain text name on the show overview page of SickChill.

## How does SickChill receive those names.?

The names are automatically provided by the indexers [theTVDB](http://thetvdb.com/).
In case there are errors in the name please change/report them to one of the above indexers.

## Where are the logos located in SickChill.?

They are located under : `*/SickBeard/gui/slick/images/network`

## How to add network logos for SickChill.?

First, you need to get your hands on a logo for that particular network. Google is your best friend here.
Once that is done use Paint.net or a similar program to edit the image.

- Make the background transparent.
- Resize the image to 64x32 pixels.
- Save it as a png.

Some guidelines for the network logos are. :

- Use colored logos.
- Try not to use black or white.

The last is because SickChill has two color themes (Dark and Light). If the logo contains too much of either color it will not show properly/correctly on one of those themes. Make sure you test/check this.

The last step is to rename the image. It needs to have the exact name of the network in the show overview list.
Also, use only lowercase characters as uppercase characters are not recognized.

Example : `Sky Atlantic` needs to be renamed to `sky atlantic` So the logo filename will be `sky atlantic.png`

Note : Special characters are not supported!

When you have the logo ready, it needs to be added to SickChill. Post the logo and exact filename on our SickChill [Discord help channel](https://discord.com/channels/502612977271439372/1048317980343283733), and one of the contributors/developers will then work with you to add it.
