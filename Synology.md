Installation guide can be found on [SynoCommunity](https://synocommunity.com)

After installing it takes **_several minutes_** for the gui to become available, if the 'package center' says running please wait and check again.   
The time it takes to become available depends on you DSM and internet connection, you only have a problem if 'package center' says stopped.

If you have an **issue** and raise a ticket please include which version you are on, DSM **6** or DSM **7**, along with the other information.

If SickChill doesn't install from package center, the package installation log at `/var/logs/packages/sichchill.log` can help identify where it went wrong before raising the **issue**.
